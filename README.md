# Project‑SDSG  
*(School Defying Software Games)*

## 🚀 What is this  
Project‑SDSG is a collection of local HTML5 games designed to run on school or restricted computers. The games require **no WiFi** and are built so that they’re unlikely to be blocked by school network filters. The goal: fun, fast, and offline‑friendly games — made solo by me (Mahdiisdumb / Mahdi Studios).  

## 🔧 Why this exists  
- Many schools block gaming websites. SDSG gives access to games without needing an internet connection.  
- It’s built to be lightweight and self‑contained so students can play games on any school computer without admin privileges or external dependencies.  
- It’s my personal project: a playground in code, testing my HTML5 / JS / frontend skills, and building something fun for peers.

## 📂 What’s inside (repo structure)  
/ (root)
│ .gitattributes
│ README.md
└─ src/
├─ pai/
├─ load.html
└─ introresources/
- `src/` — contains all of the game files (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, assets) for each included game.  
- `.gitattributes` — for repository config (if used).  
- `README.md` — this file.  

> **Note:** As this is a solo project, naming of folders or files may not follow a strict schema — but games are separated for clarity under `src/`.  

## 📝 How to use / play  
1. Clone or download the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mahdiisdumb/Project-SDSG.git
✅ What works / what to expect

HTML5 + JavaScript games that run fully offline.

Minimal dependencies beyond a web browser.

Simple, lightweight games — good for old / restricted hardware.

🎯 What this project is not

Not a polished “gaming platform” — no user accounts, online scoreboards, or authentication.

No guarantee that every school’s filters will allow local files.

Not a commercial product — this is a personal, hobby‑level project.
