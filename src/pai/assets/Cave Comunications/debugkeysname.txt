If playerName === ">!<", then the following debugging keys shall be active:
- g = Genocide Boss
- G = Genocide Ending
- p = Pacifist Boss
- P = Pacifist Ending
- n = Neutral Boss
- N = Neutral Ending
">!<" is a legacy hitmarker variable from the original slur mechanic. It displayed as (|x|>|!|<|x) with a sliding bar (|) moving across the sequence. The goal was to hit the ! — the closer the hit, the more severe the slur effect hence the >!< name. This mechanic has since been removed, but the debug keys remain for testing purposes.
