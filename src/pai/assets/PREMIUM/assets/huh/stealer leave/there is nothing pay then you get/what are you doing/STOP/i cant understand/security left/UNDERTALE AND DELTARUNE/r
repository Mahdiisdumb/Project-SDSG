There is a problem with this so let me just do teach you how to actually work this.
when it asks for your undertale or deltarune install head over to were you have installed sdsg open src then pai then assets then premium then assets in there you should see 3 folders 'huh', 'Undertale' and 'Deltarune' donot select huh becuase its litrally a labrinth to keep piraters out since they didnt pay 20 bucks for this premium.
select either undertale or deltarune and select the data.win file in there and it should work just fine.
if you have any other issues just ask me. remember this is a beta so there will be bugs.
also if it says popup blocked just allow it its safe i promise becuase im Mahdiisdumb and i would never try to harm you with a virus or anything. becuase i play these too
wifi is required for this to work so make sure you have a stable connection but when its fully loaded you can go offline and it should still work but music may be broken.
and i didnt made this .shortpie did so all credits to them for making this possible.
have fun playing sdsg with undertale and deltarune assets!
and also this is one of a kind chance please dont complain about it not working becuase it sort of works and you should be grateful for it.
thank you for using this mod have a nice day!
